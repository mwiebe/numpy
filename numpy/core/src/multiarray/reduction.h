/*
 * This function initializes a result array for a reduction operation
 * which has no identity. This means it needs to copy the first element
 * it sees along the reduction axes to result, then return a view of
 * the operand which excludes that element.
 *
 * If a reduction has an identity, such as 0 or 1, the result should
 * be initialized by calling PyArray_AssignZero(result, NULL, !skipna, NULL)
 * or PyArray_AssignOne(result, NULL, !skipna, NULL), because this
 * function raises an exception when there are no elements to reduce.
 *
 * For regular reduction, this means it copies the subarray indexed
 * at zero along each reduction axis into 'result', then returns a view
 * into 'operand' excluding those copied elements. If 'operand' has
 * an NA mask in this case, the caller should have already done
 * the reduction on the mask. This function copies the subarray with
 * 'replacena' set to True, so that the already accumulated NA mask
 * in result doesn't get overwritten.
 *
 * For 'skipna' reduction, this is more complicated. In the one dimensional
 * case, it searches for the first non-NA element, copies that element
 * to 'result', then returns a view into the rest of 'operand'. For
 * multi-dimensional reductions, the initial elements may be scattered
 * throughout the array.
 *
 * To deal with this, a view of 'operand' is taken, and given its own
 * copy of the NA mask. Additionally, an array of flags is created,
 * matching the shape of 'result', and initialized to all False.
 * Then, the elements of the 'operand' view are gone through, and any time
 * an exposed element is encounted which isn't already flagged in the
 * auxiliary array, it is copied into 'result' and flagged as copied.
 * The element is masked as an NA in the view of 'operand', so that the
 * later reduction step will skip it during processing.
 *
 * result  : The array into which the result is computed. This must have
 *           the same number of dimensions as 'operand', but for each
 *           axis i where 'axis_flags[i]' is True, it has a single element.
 * operand : The array being reduced.
 * axis_flags : An array of boolean flags, one for each axis of 'operand'.
 *              When a flag is True, it indicates to reduce along that axis.
 * reorderable : If True, the reduction being done is reorderable, which
 *               means specifying multiple axes of reduction at once is ok,
 *               and the reduction code may calculate the reduction in an
 *               arbitrary order. The calculation may be reordered because
 *               of cache behavior or multithreading requirements.
 * skipna  : If True, indicates that the reduction is being calculated
 *           as if the NA values are being dropped from the computation
 *           instead of accumulating into an NA result.
 * out_skip_first_count : This gets populated with the number of first-visit
 *                        elements that should be skipped during the
 *                        iteration loop.
 * funcname : The name of the reduction operation, for the purpose of
 *            better quality error messages. For example, "numpy.max"
 *            would be a good name for NumPy's max function.
 *
 * Returns a view which contains the remaining elements on which to do
 * the reduction.
