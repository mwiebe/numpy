NumPy 2.0.0 Release Notes
=========================

[Possibly 1.7.0 release notes, as ABI compatibility is still being maintained]

Highlights
==========


New features
============

Support for NA missing values similar to those in R has been implemented.
This was done by adding optional NA masks to the core array object.

Support for NA is not complete, here is a list of the things that do and
do not work with NA values:

What works with NA:
    * Basic indexing and slicing, as well as full boolean mask indexing.
    * All element-wise ufuncs.
    * UFunc.reduce methods, with a new skipna parameter.
    * Array methods:
       + ndarray.clip
       + ndarray.conjugate, 

What doesn't work with NA:
    * Fancy indexing, such as with lists and partial boolean masks.
    * UFunc.reduce of multi-dimensional arrays, with skipna=True and a ufunc
      that doesn't have an identity.
    * UFunc.accumulate, UFunc.reduceat.
    * np.logical_and, np.logical_or, np.all, and np.any don't satisfy the
      rules NA | True == True and NA & False == False yet.
    * Array methods:
       + ndarray.argmax, ndarray.argmin,


Custom formatter for printing arrays
------------------------------------



Changes
=======



Deprecations
============

Specifying a custom string formatter with a `_format` array attribute is
deprecated. The new `formatter` keyword in ``numpy.set_printoptions`` or
``numpy.array2string`` can be used instead.
